        So you've decided to find out more about me. That's fantastic. On this
        page, I'll talk about my favorite shows, my hobbies, and an interesting
        fact about myself.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="tvranks">
      <h3><b>Shows:</b></h3>
      <p>
        I have bunch shows that I like and it's hard for me to rank all of them,
        which is why I narrowed it into 3 shows. These are my top 3 shows:
      </p>
      <table width="50%" border="solid">
        <tr class="tbrow">
          <th>Rank</th>
          <th>Show's Name</th>
          <th>Reason</th>
        </tr>
        <tr class="tv1">
          <td>#1</td>
          <td>How I met Your Mother</td>
          <td>
            This show was hilarous. I remeber I cried at each episode of how
            hard I laughed.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="tv2">
          <td>#2</td>
          <td>Vikings: Valhalla</td>
          <td>
            I love the action, the plot, but most importanly who doesn't love
            Vikings.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="tv3">
          <td>#3</td>
          <td>Monster</td>
          <td>
            The show has great roster of characters and it is full of twists and
            pushes you to put some really serious questions.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3><b>Hobbies:</b></h3>
      <p class="hobbies">
        At the momment I have two hobbies. Gaming is the first of my hobbies. I
        currently game everyday day with friends, we normally play games such as
        Warzone and Elden Ring.I picked My second Hobby not too long ago which
        is coding. Lately I've been having fun coding and learning more about
        it.

    <div id="fact">
      <b><h3>An interesting fact about me:</h3></b>
      <p>
        I enjoy hearing this PS1 intro because it relaxes me; if you don't
        believe me, try it for yourself:
      </p>
      <img src="/images/relax.jpg" width="400" height="300" />
      <iframe
        width="560"
        height="315"
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oAhvQoLpvsM"
        title="YouTube video player"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
        allowfullscreen
      ></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
      It relaxes me because it reminds me of when I used to come home from
      school. As a kid, you either watched shows or afterschool programs, but
      for me, it was to jump on my Ps1.
